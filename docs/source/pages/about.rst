The webb_scraping code is intended to supplement explorations of exoplanet data for James Webb purposes. The program pulls from a variety of sources (`ExoFOP-TESS <https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/tess/>`_, `MAST <https://archive.stsci.edu/index.html>`_, and `SIMBAD <https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid>`_) to aggregate data relevant to a potential JWST proposal.

webb_scraping is `being actively developed on GitHub
<https://github.com/arjunsavel/webb_scraping>`_. If you find bugs or would like to make a contribution, please `open an issue <https://github.com/arjunsavel/webb_scraping/issues>`_!
